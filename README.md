## [Description](#table-of-contents)

Internet retail, also known as e-commerce, is the largest sector of the electronics industry, generating an estimated $29 trillion in 2019. E-commerce platforms like Shopify and WooCommerce provide a suite of services to businesses of all sizes. Since this is a back end application, we use applications like [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/), [Postman](https://www.postman.com/),  or [Thunder Client](https://www.thunderclient.com/) the application I will be using for this video walkthrough.

### User Story

```
AS A manager at an internet retail company
I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies
SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies
```
