## [Description](#table-of-contents)

Internet retail, also known as e-commerce, is the largest sector of the electronics industry, generating an estimated $29 trillion in 2019. E-commerce platforms like Shopify and WooCommerce provide a suite of services to businesses of all sizes. Since this is a back end application, we use applications like [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/), [Postman](https://www.postman.com/),  or [Thunder Client](https://www.thunderclient.com/) the application I will be using for this video walkthrough.

### User Story

```
AS A manager at an internet retail company
I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies
SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies
```

### Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a functional Express.js API
WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for categories, products, or tags
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
```

## [Installation](#table-of-contents)
This application requires that you download the following packages using Node to run this application:

</p>

The NPM packages are on the package.json for you to simply run this command in your terminal to install the npm pakages needed:

```
npm i
```
once I have done that in order to run the application with Data already in the application i must first create my database and seed it with the sql files inside the DB folder

Below is a short GIF to help you understand exact steps for installation for a smooth application run:

![installationGIF](./assets/installation.gif)

once sql files have been sourced in MYSQL, and the seeds have been ran through npm, run the following command in your terminal

```
npm start
```

## [Resources](#table-of-contents)

Using the My Sql DB application is a great resource for viewing models if a visual aspect of your models gives you a better prespective on how all the models end up connecting.

Below is an example of the models created using E-commerce back end models:
